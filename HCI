fashion and function 

"Balancing function and fashion" in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) means making digital things both easy to use and look nice. 
It's like having a phone app that works well and also looks cool. Functionality means making sure people can use the app easily to do what they need to do. 
Fashion is about making the app look good with nice colors and designs that people like. Finding the right balance means making sure the app is practical and looks good, so people enjoy using it. 
It's about making digital stuff that not only works smoothly but also feels good and looks appealing. When designers get this balance right it makes using technology more fun and enjoyable for everyone.
